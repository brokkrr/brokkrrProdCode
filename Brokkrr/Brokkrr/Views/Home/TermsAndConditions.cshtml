                    PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE BROKKRR APPLICATIONS OR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY US, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE BROKKRR APPLICATION OR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY US.<br /><br />
                    THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SITES TO BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN A COURT. THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY ARBITRATION INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS.<br /><br />
                    These terms of service (these “Terms”) apply to your access and use of the mobile applications, websites, emails, text messages and social media accounts (collectively, the “Application”) owned, operated or provided by brokkrr, Inc. (“brokkrr”, “we”, “our” or “us”) and any feature, content, tools and services accessible by means of the Application as well as seeking insurance agents or brokers through the Service. The Application and these services are collectively referred to as the “Service.” These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with brokkrr for the Service (or any part thereof). If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on the entity’s behalf, and that the entity agrees to be responsible to brokkrr if you violate these Terms.<br /><br />
                    Your use of the Service is conditioned upon the version of these Terms in force at the time of your use. We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. All changes to these Terms are effective immediately when we post them and apply to use of the Application and Services thereafter. If you continue to access or use the Service following our posting of any changes to these Terms, we will consider that you have accepted the changes. Therefore, you must regularly review these Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of the Service. If you do not agree to the changed Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Service. We also recommend you regularly update to the most recent version of our mobile applications to allow you to
                    take advantage of new functionality and to ensure you have access to the most recent terms of service and promotional offer terms (changes thereto aren’t viewable until you update the apps). You recognize that changes to the terms and/or promotional offers may occur and that you will be bound to these changes, notwithstanding the fact that you were not aware of them due to your failure to update the app. Your use of the app, and failure to update to the most recent version, constitutes your agreement that brokkrr shall have no liability to you, and you release brokkrr, and its parent, officers, directors employees and agents, from and against any liability, for any changes to terms of service or promotional offers which were available but that which you were not aware of due to your failure to update the app.<br /><br />
                    If you have any questions regarding the use of the Service, please email us at <u>info@brokkrr.com</u>.<br /><br />

The terms of the license will also govern any upgrades provided by brokkrr that replace and/or supplement the original Application, unless the upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.
                    You will not do, and will not authorize or permit any third party to do, any of the following: (i) distribute or make the Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time; (ii) rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Application; (iii) copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify or create derivative works of the Application, any updates or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any of the foregoing restrictions are prohibited by applicable law) or (iv) remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice on or in the Application. If you violate any of the foregoing restrictions, your right to use of the Application will immediately cease, and you will have infringed the copyright and other rights of brokkrr, which may subject you to prosecution and damages. brokkrr reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms.<br /><br />

                    <b>CONSENT TO USE OF DATA AND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS</b><br /><br />
                    In exchange for brokkrr providing you with access to the Service, you consent to brokkrr collecting and using technical data, personal information and related information in connection with your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, contact information and technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that are gathered periodically to facilitate the features and functionality of the Service and of software updates, product support and other services.

                    <b>CARRIER CHARGES</b><br /><br />
                    The Service requires and uses phone service, data access and text messaging capabilities. Carrier rates for phone, data and text messaging may apply, and you are responsible for all of these charges.<br /><br />

                    <b>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</b><br /><br />
                    brokkrr attempts to be as accurate as possible. If you have reason to believe that the agent through the Service or other product or feature does not meet the claims advertised within the Service, you must contact brokkrr immediately (and in any case no later than three business days following the issue). Your failure to contact us within this period may affect our ability to investigate and resolve your claim.<br /><br />

                    When you obtain insurance through an agent or broker using the Service, you are representing that any information you supply is true and complete.<br /><br />

BROKKRR DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN) WITH RESPECT TO THESE

BROKKRR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE APPLICATION WILL BE ACCURATE OR MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE APPLICATION WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION, GUIDELINES OR ADVICE GIVEN BY BROKKRR OR OUR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES WILL CREATE A WARRANTY.<br /><br />

                    <b>INDEMNIFICATION</b><br /><br />
                    You will defend, indemnify and hold us, our independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and their respective directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all actual or threatened third-party suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), claims, damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees, costs, penalties, interest and disbursements) caused by, arising out of, resulting from, attributable to or in any way incidental to (i) your conduct; (ii) your violation of these Terms or your violation of the rights of any third party; or (iii) any User Content you share.<br /><br />

                    <b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b><br /><br />
                    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL BROKKRR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, BUSINESS, CONTRACTS, REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS; LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE APPLICATION), HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR
                    IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY) AND EVEN IF BROKKRR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL BROKKRR’S TOTAL LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE APPLICATION) EXCEED $100.00 UNITED STATES DOLLARS.<br /><br />

WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTS OF NEW JERSEY, BROKKRR WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE THE RESULT OF OUR NEGLIGENT, RECKLESS OR INTENTIONAL ACTS OR OMISSIONS.<br /><br />

                    <b>BINDING ARBITRATION</b><br /><br />
                    You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Sites, use of the Sites, and/or these Terms of Use shall be settled by binding arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration against brokkrr, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees. In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, brokkrr will pay as much of the claimant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration
                    as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor brokkrr shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.<br /><br />

                    BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.<br /><br />

                    <b>REPEAT INFRINGER POLICY</b><br /><br />
                    In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable law, brokkrr has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at brokkrr’s sole discretion, subscribers or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers. brokkrr may also at our sole discretion limit access to the Service and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.<br /><br />

                    <b>COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS</b><br /><br />
                    If you believe that any material made available via the Service infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, or that any link made available via the Service directs users to material that infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may file a notification of such infringement with our Designated Agent as set forth below.<br /><br />

                    See 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) for the requirements of a proper notification. If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages including, but not limited to, costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.<br /><br />

                    <b>APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE</b><br /><br />
                    The Terms and your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, the Application will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. In the event of any matter or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms that is not subject to binding arbitration, you and brokkrr will submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of California.<br /><br />
                    
                    <b>EXPORT LIMITATIONS</b><br /><br />
